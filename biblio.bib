###### HOW-TO ######

To add a new entry in your bibliography chose the proper template below, copy-
paste it in the end of this file, replace the "_" by an "at-symbol" (this
symbol cannot be typed here otherwise the bibliography processing program
would think there's an entry inside this how-to), and fill its fields. Check
an proper entry example in the end of this file.

You can use the month macros (jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep,
oct, nov, dec) WITHOUT QUOTES to let the bib-style handle the language of the
month (French or English), like in the example in the end of the file.

Optional fields in the templates are commented out with a '%'. Note that not
all external programs that process bibliography information in .bib files
support comments inside the reference entry (notably bibtex doesn't), so you
may need to remove the fields you don't want/need in your entry instead of
leaving it commented out. Moreover, anything not starting with a "at-symbol"
is normally not processed by the bibliography processing program (like it was
just comments).

	abstract = {This paper provides a broad perspective and analysis of the work done in control of hybrid and convertible unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the main existing designs. These flying machines are capable of vertical take off and landing (VTOL) in helicopter mode and able to transition to high-speed forward flight in airplane mode and vice versa. This paper aims at helping engineers and researchers develop flight control systems for VTOL UAVs. To this end, a historical perspective first shows the technological advances in VTOL aircraft over the years. The main VTOL concepts and state-of-art flight control methods for VTOL UAVs are presented and discussed. This study shows both the common parts and the fundamental differences in the modeling, guidance, control, and control allocation for each hybrid-VTOL-UAV type. The open challenges and the current trends in the field are highlighted. These are namely: 1) augmenting or replacing classical controllers with data-driven methods such as neural networks and machine-learning-based controllers; 2) incorporating as much knowledge of the vehicle as possible into the flight controller, for example through model predictive control or model-based nonlinear controllers; 3) a trend towards finding a unified-control approach valid in all flight modes without the need to switch among flight controllers or to perform predefined-gain scheduling, and 4) the need to mitigate control complexity and available computing resources.},

	abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive overview on the recent advances of miniature hybrid Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). For now, two conventional types, i.e., fixed-wing UAV and Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) UAV, dominate the miniature UAVs. Each type has its own inherent limitations on flexibility, payload, flight range, cruising speed, takeoff and landing requirements and endurance. Enhanced popularity and interest are recently gained by the newer type, named hybrid UAV, that integrates the beneficial features of both conventional ones. In this survey paper, a systematic categorization method for the hybrid UAV's platform designs is introduced, first presenting the technical features and representative examples. Next, the hybrid UAV's flight dynamics model and flight control strategies are explained addressing several representative modeling and control work. In addition, key observations, existing challenges and conclusive remarks based on the conducted review are discussed accordingly.},
