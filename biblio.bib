###### HOW-TO ######

To add a new entry in your bibliography chose the proper template below, copy-
paste it in the end of this file, replace the "_" by an "at-symbol" (this
symbol cannot be typed here otherwise the bibliography processing program
would think there's an entry inside this how-to), and fill its fields. Check
an proper entry example in the end of this file.

You can use the month macros (jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep,
oct, nov, dec) WITHOUT QUOTES to let the bib-style handle the language of the
month (French or English), like in the example in the end of the file.

Optional fields in the templates are commented out with a '%'. Note that not
all external programs that process bibliography information in .bib files
support comments inside the reference entry (notably bibtex doesn't), so you
may need to remove the fields you don't want/need in your entry instead of
leaving it commented out. Moreover, anything not starting with a "at-symbol"
is normally not processed by the bibliography processing program (like it was
just comments).
