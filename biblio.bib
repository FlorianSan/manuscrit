###### HOW-TO ######

To add a new entry in your bibliography chose the proper template below, copy-
paste it in the end of this file, replace the "_" by an "at-symbol" (this
symbol cannot be typed here otherwise the bibliography processing program
would think there's an entry inside this how-to), and fill its fields. Check
an proper entry example in the end of this file.

You can use the month macros (jan, feb, mar, apr, may, jun, jul, aug, sep,
oct, nov, dec) WITHOUT QUOTES to let the bib-style handle the language of the
month (French or English), like in the example in the end of the file.

Optional fields in the templates are commented out with a '%'. Note that not
all external programs that process bibliography information in .bib files
support comments inside the reference entry (notably bibtex doesn't), so you
may need to remove the fields you don't want/need in your entry instead of
leaving it commented out. Moreover, anything not starting with a "at-symbol"
is normally not processed by the bibliography processing program (like it was
just comments).

These flying machines are capable of vertical take off and landing (VTOL) in helicopter mode and able to transition to high-speed forward flight in airplane mode and vice versa. This paper aims at helping engineers and researchers develop flight control systems for VTOL UAVs. To this end, a historical perspective first shows the technological advances in VTOL aircraft over the years. The main VTOL concepts and state-of-art flight control methods for VTOL UAVs are presented and discussed. This study shows both the common parts and the fundamental differences in the modeling, guidance, control, and control allocation for each hybrid-VTOL-UAV type. The open challenges and the current trends in the field are highlighted. These are namely: 1) augmenting or replacing classical controllers with data-driven methods such as neural networks and machine-learning-based controllers; 2) incorporating as much knowledge of the vehicle as possible into the flight controller, for example through model predictive control or model-based nonlinear controllers; 3) a trend towards finding a unified-control approach valid in all flight modes without the need to switch among flight controllers or to perform predefined-gain scheduling, and 4) the need to mitigate control complexity and available computing resources.},

Previous work has focused on hover controller design and performance culminating in a flight consisting of a manually piloted vertical take-off, hover, and vertical landing. A new testbed vehicle is constructed based on the lessons learned from this previous work that is suitable for manual and autonomous flight in transition. An adaptive autopilot is designed in the transition and forward flight regions in a flight-capable software environment. This autopilot is finally implemented on flight control hardware on the testbed vehicle. Successful manually piloted flight tests are conducted in which the vehicle takes off vertically, transitions to a nearly forward flight configuration, and returns back to vertical flight mode for landing. Next steps include validating the autonomous vertical take-off, hover, transition to forward flight, and vertical landing performance with the integrated adaptive autopilot. }

The VTOL freewing configuration belongs to the class of transition aircraft that have traditionally required gain-scheduled linear controllers or control switching strategies to maintain stable flight in a wide range of operations, including the highly nonlinear transition region. This work implements a unified control strategy for a freewing unmanned aerial system (UAS), including all phases of vertical flight, transition, and forward flight. A neural net-based model reference adaptive controller (MRAC) architecture is implemented to manage both the inner loop attitude state and outer-loop translational state control. Modeling errors output from a dynamic inversion element are corrected with a single hidden layer neural network and techniques to combat actuator saturation are included. Simulation results of the freewing concept include successful transition to and from forward flight with the implemented adaptive controller. The adaptive autopilot is integrated with a commercially available flight control software on a flight testbed UAS with initial hover flight test results presented. }

abstract = {The Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with the tilt-rotor mechanism also known as hybrid UAVs have a lot of challenges in designing and controlling concerning their use in harsh weather for surveillance and access to remote areas. This review paper presents a review of the preliminary design of hybrid aircraft and control systems. The tilt-rotor mechanism and tilt wings of a hybrid UAV are analyzed. The paper provides an outline of technical advances in UAVs in hybrid configuration concerning their constraint analysis, propulsion sizing, and design evaluation. Furthermore, the flight dynamics modeling is described with the control system and dynamics of the hybrid UAV. This paper lists various software for simulations and analysis such as SOLIDWORKS and CATIA for CAD modeling, MATLAB and SIMULINK for mathematical modeling and flight control, and XFLR5 for stability analysis of aerofoils, wings, and planes. In addition, certain control strategies are executed and scrutinized in terms of the theory, the linearity, and the implementation of the model.},

	abstract = {This article presents a comprehensive overview on the recent advances of miniature hybrid Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). For now, two conventional types, i.e., fixed-wing UAV and Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) UAV, dominate the miniature UAVs. Each type has its own inherent limitations on flexibility, payload, flight range, cruising speed, takeoff and landing requirements and endurance. Enhanced popularity and interest are recently gained by the newer type, named hybrid UAV, that integrates the beneficial features of both conventional ones. In this survey paper, a systematic categorization method for the hybrid UAV's platform designs is introduced, first presenting the technical features and representative examples. Next, the hybrid UAV's flight dynamics model and flight control strategies are explained addressing several representative modeling and control work. In addition, key observations, existing challenges and conclusive remarks based on the conducted review are discussed accordingly.},

abstract = {We describe an experimental platform for testing the DarkO tail-sitter drone in an open wind tunnel experiment. The DarkO convertible UAV is developed and 3D printed at the Ecole Nationale de l'Aviation Civile (ENAC), in Toulouse (France). The objective of the experimental platform is to allow testing control laws in a realistic and secure context. We propose a test bench with a single degree of freedom corresponding to the drone pitch axis. We design a linear proportional/integral feedback hovering stabilizer in the presence of constant wind, and we illustrate its effectiveness in stabilizing a hovering position through experimental results.}
