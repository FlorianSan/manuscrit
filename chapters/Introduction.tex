Convertible drones have the ability to take off or land vertically and fly like an airplane. They are promising architectures providing energy efficient flight capabilities for strong endurance, as compared with classical coplanar UAVs, like quadcopters. This high degree of autonomy is highly desirable in classic applications such as visual detection tasks (e.g. surveillance, aerial photography, etc.), but also for environmental exploration and physical interaction.
