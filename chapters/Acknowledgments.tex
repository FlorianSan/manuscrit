% Here you can see an example of how to create text conditioned by the language
% variable. The \iftoggle command:
%
%   \iftoggle{ThesisInEnglish}{%
%   <your-text-in-english>
%   }{%
%   <your-text-in-french>
%   }
%
% will compile only one of the two blocks, depending on the variable you set at
% the beginning of this document. Language selection is managed this way in the
% formatAndDefs.tex file. You too can create sections of your thesis that is
% language dependend this way, although you probably won't need it. Another use
% of \iftoggle can be found at the end of this file.
\iftoggle{ThesisInEnglish}{%
\section*{Acknowledgments}
}{%
\section*{Remerciements}
}

A faire en dernier :-)
